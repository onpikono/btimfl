# This Life

**Artist:** Moon Sung Nam (문성남)

Stay with me like this without a sound\
As if we're quietly together by fate\
There's no more scent left at all\
But I still feel it

Stay with me\
Come with me

Nothing has changed but I'm getting used to it\
Feels like time has stopped\
The moment gets far away\
And only blinking lights remain

Stay with me\
Come with me

Days that have passed in countless time\
Stay like this\
I'm leaving alone on a different path

Stay with me\
Come with me

Stay with me like this without a sound\
As if we're quietly together by fate
