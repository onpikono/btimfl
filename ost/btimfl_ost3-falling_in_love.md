# Feel Like Falling in Love

**Artist:** MeloMance

So many things to do\
And I don't want to waste my emotions\
So to me, the emotions of love\
Are all useless

That's what I tell myself\
But then you flicker before me\
Shaking me up

I start to hate love\
But whenever you're in front of me\
I want to hold your hand\
I think I like you\
You make me want to love you

We'll break up anyway\
Then nothing will be left\
I try to tell myself\
That love is useless

That's what I tell myself\
But at your single smile\
I'm so out of it and I'm shaking

(2x)
I start to hate love\
But whenever you're in front of me\
I want to hold your hand\
I think I like you\
You make me want to love you

I start to hate love\
But whenever you're in front of me\
I want to date you\
I think I like you\
You make me want to love you
You make me want to love you
