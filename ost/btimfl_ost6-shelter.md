# Shelter

**Artist:** Hee Jin ft. Lee Yo Han

The air is different from yesterday\
Everything has changed\
I'm different from yesterday\
Where should I go?

I could not even breathe\
It was too much\
I was lost and wondering\
Nowhere to go

Let me borrow your warm shoulder for a moment\
Please be my shelter for my exhausted soul\
Let me give you my scarred heart for a moment\
You can just look at me once in a while

Frozen in the dawn fog\
The light has disappeared from the small hand\
But a small flower blooms again\
Let's go find the morning sun

Let me borrow your warm shoulder for a moment\
Please be my shelter for my exhausted soul\
Let me give you my scarred heart for a moment\
You can just look at me once in a while

The air is different from yesterday\
Everything has changed\
I'm different from yesterday\
Where should I go?
