# Can't Go

**Artist:** Ben (ë²¤)

Dreams that filled my room\
Lost meaning page by page, now they have fated\
Written in the past on all those small papers\
Now I'm blanking out

It's not easy to look at a different tomorrow\
So I can't even do anything

Even if I endure through a day like today\
Each day keeps repeating\
Foolish things keep repeating\
So I'm standing in a corner by myself\
Thinking maybe tomorrow will be different\
I can't take a single step

Future hopes that I wanted to fulfill\
They're still stuck at that time\
Sometimes I long for the young days\
Because if I stand there again, maybe I can smile

Now I'm used to the same things\
Repeating over and over\
So the time is just passing like that

Even if I endure through a day like today\
Each day keeps repeating\
Foolish things keep repeating\
So I'm standing in a corner by myself\
Thinking maybe tomorrow will be different\
I can't take a single step

Even if it's just a moment, it's all right\
I'm drawing myself out as I'm in a movie

Even if I endure through a day like today\
Each day keeps repeating\
Foolish things keep repeating\
So I'm standing in a corner by myself\
Thinking maybe tomorrow will be different\
I can't take a single step
