# Drawing a Star (별 그림)

**Artist:** Uji (유지)

All day, I think of you\
All day, back and forth\
I count the endless stars

Without time to rest\
Everything passes by again today

Lalala lalalala lalala lalalala\
I am thinking about you\
Lalala lalalala lalala lalalala\
As I quietly smile

Without anyone knowing\
I am drawing out the countless stars\
Without anyone knowing\
I am quietly closing my eyes

_Guitar Solo._

All day, back and forth\
Everyone look for me\
All day, up and down\
I just cannot figure it out

Without time to rest\
Everything passes by agian today

Lalala lalalala lalala lalalala\
I am thinking about you\
Lalala lalalala lalala lalalala\
As I quietly smile

Without anyone knowing\
I am drawing out the countless stars\
Without anyone knowing\
I am quietly closing my eyes

Lalala lalalala lalala lalalala\
I am thinking about you\
Lalala lalalala lalala lalalala\
As I quietly smile
