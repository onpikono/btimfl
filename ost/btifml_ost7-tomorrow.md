# Tomorrow

**Artist:** Ryu Ji Hyun (류지현)

Everything I believed in for a long time\
One by one they slowly change\
I don't know, I don't even know about today\
As I'm slowly being pulled to you

When tomorrow comes I'll worry\
About the small longing in my heart again\
But when tomorrow comes, maybe\
Maybe we can smile again

It's as I have been like this for a very long time\
All of this seems like nothing to me\
I don't know, I don't even know about today\
As I'm slowly being pulled to you

When tomorrow comes I'll worry\
About the small longing in my heart again\
But when tomorrow comes, maybe\
Maybe we can smile again

I just cannot understand\
But I'm getting more and more used to it

When tomorrow comes I'll worry\
About the small longing in my heart again\
But when tomorrow comes, maybe\
Maybe we can smile again
