# Marriage

**Artist:** MoonMoon (문문)

Marriage is about\
Picking pretty words\
Saying pretty compliments\
And making a pretty night

Marriage is about\
Meeting a good person\
Having a good love\
And buying a good house

But that's hard for me\
So I'm just turning on the TV by myself\
Going outside in comfortable clothes\
Buying strong alcohol by myself

So I'm going to Namsan by myself\
I'm walking along the Han River by myself\
I'm eating dinner because\
It's all too hard

If you only have used-up words for comfort\
You can just pass by\
Don't criticize me for living without love\
Don't feel bad for me right now\
Except when I eat dinner alone

About love and what's after that\
Sometimes you make bad faces, pointy words\
Saying hurtful things

Then you become strangers\
So this is how i feel\
I'm afraid of that\
That's hard for me

So I'm just watching TV\
So I'm just watching TV\
So I'm just watching TV
