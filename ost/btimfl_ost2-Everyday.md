# Every Day

**Artist:** Han Hae Bin (해빈)

I'm in love\
The moment I fell for you\
Show your love\
It's so strange, I don't feel like myself

When we're alone\
I start to smile\
Sometimes, when I awkwardly avoid your eyes\
Thant means that I

You are my everything\
Open my closed heart\
Loving you\
Come closer to me\
Hold me more warmly\
Until always\

I want to be a special person\
I want to tell you, if you're waiting\
I'm in love with you, every day

I'm thinking of you again today\
Not able to sleep all night\
Then I got curious\
I wonder how you feel

I was thinking what to tell you first\
Then I just said things I did not even mean\
That means that I

You are my everything\
Open my closed heart\
Loving you\
Come closer to me\
Hold me more warmly\
Until always

I want to be a special person\
I want to tell you, if you're waiting\
I'm in love with you
Every day

Only you are in my head\
I can't do anything\
That's how much I am thinking of you

You are my everything\
Stay by my side every day\
Fall in love with me\
Would you be my one love?\
Look at me\
Until always

I want to be a special person\
I want to tell you, if you're waiting\
I'm in love with you
Every day
