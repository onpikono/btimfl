# Because You Are Beside Me

**Artist:** Jung So Min (정소민)

Walking on this street alone\
Crying alone at night\
I couldn't find a place for me anywhere

Do you remember the day we first met?\
Your face, your warmth\
Comforted me more than anything else

I could see\
Because of you\
My dream didn't disappear\
Over the clouds in the dark, night sky\
The stars twinkled

Don't forget\
Even when I'm happy\
Even when I'm lonely and sad\
No one can replace you

I want to believe\
Because of you\
I'm walking again\
My faraway footsteps are going to you\
The love that pulled me through

In this moment right now\
If your heart feels the same way I do\
If you feel the same way I do

I can see\
Because of you\
My dream didn't disappear\
Over the clouds in the dark, night sky\
The stars twinkled

I want to believe\
Because of you\
I'm walking again\
My faraway footsteps are going to you\
The love that pulled me through
